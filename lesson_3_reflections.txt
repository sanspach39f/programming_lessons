Udemy Git Training Reflections
_______________________________

1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I expect to be using multiple computers for one project or if it is a big project being 
	worked on by multiple programmers.



2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	I don't really know.If we are constantly staying up-to-date with the remote and it is CONSTANTLY
	being edited by other programmers, it can get tedious trying to keep up with the changes and code,
	especially if it's not relevant to what we are specifically working on



3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


	Forks are when you want to take a repository in GitHub and copy it onto your repository in GitHub.
	Clones let you take a repository on Github or somewhere on your computer and add it to your current directory.
	Branches let you take a repository on your local computer and generate a new copy of it to experiment with.
